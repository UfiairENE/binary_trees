The aim of this project is to understand the following,
# binary tree
# difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
# possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
# the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
# different traversal methods to go through a binary tree and 
# complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
